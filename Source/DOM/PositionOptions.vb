'''<summary>The PositionOptions dictionary describes an object containing option properties to pass as a parameter of Geolocation.getCurrentPosition() and Geolocation.watchPosition().</summary>

Public Interface [PositionOptions]
  '''<summary>Is a Boolean that indicates the application would like to receive the best possible results. If true and if the device is able to provide a more accurate position, it will do so. Note that this can result in slower response times or increased power consumption (with a GPS chip on a mobile device for example). On the other hand, if false, the device can take the liberty to save resources by responding more quickly and/or using less power. Default: false.</summary>
  Property [enableHighAccuracy] As Boolean
  '''<summary>Is a positive long value representing the maximum length of time (in milliseconds) the device is allowed to take in order to return a position. The default value is Infinity, meaning that getCurrentPosition() won't return until the position is available.</summary>
  Property [timeout] As Long
  '''<summary>Is a positive long value indicating the maximum age in milliseconds of a possible cached position that is acceptable to return. If set to 0, it means that the device cannot use a cached position and must attempt to retrieve the real current position. If set to Infinity the device must return a cached position regardless of its age. Default: 0.</summary>
  Property [maximumAge] As Long
